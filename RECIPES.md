## Linux

### Albert Launcher

You can use the [albert](https://github.com/albertlauncher/albert) launcher along with two `.desktop` files to allow you to trigger this script from the launcher. An example of a desktop file for this is:

```
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Desk - Sit
Exec=/home/user/idasen-controller/venv/bin/python /home/user/idasen-controller/main.py --sit
Icon=/home/user/idasen-controller/sit-icon.png
Type=Application
Comment=Lower desk to sitting height.

```

## Windows

### Autohotkey

A AutoHotkey script from @aienabled to drive the desk to stand and sit mode by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Up or Down arrow respectively:

```
;Idasen Desk - Stand
^!+Up::Run "C:\Users\...\Desk - Stand.lnk"

;Idasen Desk - Sit
^!+Down::Run "C:\Users\...\Desk - Sit.lnk"
```

These are shortcut files on the desktop but it's not necessary and could be simple python calls.
